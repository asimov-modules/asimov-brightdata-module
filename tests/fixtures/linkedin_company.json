Imagine how different this project would look today with data-packed LLMs and AI agents collecting web data at scale. The game has officially changed! We’re thinking about Season 2! Got any ideas? Drop them in the comments. Thanks again to our Iron Analysts who made the first season happen: Ken Jee , Shashank Kalanithi , Avery Smith , Zach Wilson , Mikiko Bazeley , Keith Galli , Tina Huang, Alex Freberg , Luke Barousse , Joshua Starmer PhD , Benjamin Rogojan , Matthew Housley , Mark Freeman , and Hunter Kempf .
